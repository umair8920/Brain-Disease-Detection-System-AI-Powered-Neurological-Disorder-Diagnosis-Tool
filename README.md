# Brain-Disease-Detection-System-AI-Powered-Neurological-Disorder-Diagnosis-Tool

Role: Full-Stack Developer (Frontend & Backend)
Technologies Used: React Native, Python (Flask), Firebase, AI/ML Models, Medical Imaging (MRI, CT)
Implemented Firebase for user authentication (login/signup) and to store patient scan histories securely.
Built and integrated AI/ML models for analyzing brain scans, focusing on detecting neurological conditions such as tumors, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease.
The Brain Disease Detection System is a sophisticated software solution designed for the early detection and diagnosis of various neurological disorders through the analysis of MRI and CT scan images. The system utilizes advanced image processing techniques and artificial intelligence to detect abnormalities indicative of brain conditions like tumors, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease. By automating the analysis process, the software enhances the accuracy and speed of diagnoses, providing invaluable support to healthcare professionals in neurology.
